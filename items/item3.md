UX Maker Lab 
Group Maker Lab Project 2  
Plug and Play Projector  
In this assignment we designed a DIY project that also helps with the  
social concern of the COVID-19 pandemic in the world as well as mental health among the people  
  
We first brainstormed ideas on what we could DIY , a box  
Then we started a project briefing document which detailed out the plan as well as the materials  
needed for the project.
We then went to blender a to design a prototype that we would then present to the class  
  
My Angle  
My role in this project was to help with coming up with ideas, creating the project briefing   document, as well as making the presentation.  
While I was thinking of ideas of what we could DIY many ideas came to mind but I tried to make  
sure that it stayed relevant to the idea of the social concern we decided to tackle which  
brought us to the idea of the DIY Projector idea.
