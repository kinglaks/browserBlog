UX 100  
Laurier Humanities and Leadership Team Project  
A agile designing process  
This was a project we did for our UX-100 class where we had to make   
the program more appealing to students who are looking for a program to get  
into for university this is one of the pages we did for it  
What we did as a team was first we met with our client and talked about the course   
and learned about it to know what we can change and make it more appealing.  
We then brainstormed ideas for how we can fix it  
Once we figured the idea out we made sure to come up with prototypes that we then  
showed the client and class in a presentation.

My Angle  
When it came to this project my role was going through the website to understand it   
and what was potentially wrong with it. Along with being one of the people that would make sure  
that the prototype was done correctly and adhering to the design principles that we had learned.
