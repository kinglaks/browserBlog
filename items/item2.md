UX Maker Lab  
Group Maker Lab Project 1  
In this assignment we had to hack a traditional box into a new design  
this is our project the Compact Desk Box  
  
We first brainstormed ideas on what we could do to hack a box, and alter its shape to allow a new  
way to use it.  
Then we started a project briefing document which detailed out the plan as well as the materials  
needed for the project.
We then went to blender a to design a prototype that we would then present to the class  
  
My Angle  
My role in this project was to help with coming up with ideas, creating the project briefing   document, as well as making the presentation.
